            <p class="text">
                Biking is an enjoyable and healthy activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a low-impact exercise that can provide numerous physical and mental benefits. One of the main benefits of biking is that it is an excellent cardiovascular workout, which helps to improve heart health, lower blood pressure, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.
            <br><br>
            Another great benefit of biking is that it can be done virtually anywhere, whether on a bike path, in a park, or even on the road. Biking is also an environmentally friendly mode of transportation, as it does not produce emissions, and thus it helps to reduce air pollution and carbon footprint.

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a popular and exciting sport that involves flying in a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing, which is inflated by the wind. The wing shape is determined by the suspension lines and the air pressure.
                <br><br>
                The equipment used for paragliding is relatively simple and lightweight, making it easy to transport and set up. The wing, harness, and reserve parachute are the main components. The wing is made of ripstop nylon and is inflated by the wind to create lift. The harness is worn by the pilot and is attached to the wing by suspension lines.
                <br><br>    
                Paragliding is a highly weather-dependent sport, and pilots must be aware of the weather conditions and take necessary precautions. Strong winds, thunderstorms, and turbulence can make flying dangerous. However, when the weather is right, paragliding can be a truly exhilarating experience, providing a unique perspective of the world below.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a popular water sport that involves riding the waves on a surfboard. It originated in ancient Polynesia and has since spread to become a beloved pastime around the world. Surfers paddle out to the ocean on their boards, waiting for the perfect wave to come along.
                The surfboard is the most important piece of equipment in surfing. It is usually made of foam or fiberglass and is shaped to match the conditions of the wave. The size and shape of the board are determined by the surfer's skill level and the size of the wave.
            <br><br>
            Surfing requires a combination of strength, skill, and patience. It takes time to learn the proper technique, and it is important to start with smaller waves and gradually work up to larger ones. Surfing is a physically demanding sport that requires balance, endurance, and flexibility.
            <br><br>
            Surfing is not only a physical activity, but also a mental one. It requires focus and concentration to anticipate the wave and make quick decisions. It can be a meditative experience, allowing surfers to disconnect from the world and be fully present in the moment.
